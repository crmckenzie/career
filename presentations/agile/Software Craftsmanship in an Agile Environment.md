# Software Craftsmanship in an Agile Environment

## Description

“Agile” has become a popular methodology over the last two decades. Businesses have been rushing to adopt agile processes because its promise to save costs and deliver working software more quickly. However, for many businesses software quality did not improve. In fact it often got worse. In response to this problem some Software Engineering leaders found it necessary to found the “Software Craftsmanship” movement. Why did agile fail to deliver on its promise of higher quality software? What can be done about it? What solutions are these craftsmen offering?

Chris explains that the core problem is the failure of engineers to properly communicate the value of technical excellence in business terms. Businesses have eagerly embraced forgoing cumbersome processes in favor of Agile processes such as Scrum and Kanban. However, the expectation of increased velocity coupled with a failure to understand the technical requirements of supporting increased change means that Agile processes are set against quality (and therefore speed) in these environments.

Come gain a deeper understanding of the communication failure between business, project management, and technical roles. Learn to address the issue of quality head-on and reap the promised rewards of Agile.

## Bio

Master Software Engineer at Parametric Portfolio Associates in Seattle, Chris McKenzie has dedicated his career to the pursuit of technical excellence. He has 17 years of experience writing software. He has often functioned in the role of trainer and mentor for others, culminating in an internship program that Parametric uses to funnel gifted beginners into the Software Development department. His particular interest is in finding the "pit of success" with whichever technology stack is being used so that it's faster and easier to do the right thing than the wrong thing.

He maintains a blog at http://www.iextendable.com where he discusses whatever is on his mind at the moment. He can also be found on twitter using the handle @ISuperGeek.
