I've had a blog for years but my blogging frequencey is intermittent. I wanted to see what a successful blogger would say, so I took John Sonmez' [Simple Programmer Blogging Course]. I can't say that there were any lightning bolt insights. If I had to boil the course down in four
words it would be "get off your ass," along with some helpful tricks to overcome common roadblocks to getting that next blog written. 

Two of my biggest bottlenecks have been trying to figure out what to write about, and perfectionism. "Did I cover everything relevant to [topic]? Did I correctly render the forest and the trees? Am I certain about the advice I gave?" Sonmez' course gave me techniques to deal with these bottlenecks for which I'm grateful.

If you are at all interested in blogging but a) are not sure how to get started, or b) have felt stalled, I would recommend that you take the course. You've got nothing to lose--it's free!
