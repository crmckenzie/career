# Deliver Working Software

In the [Principles behind the Agile Manifesto] it states that we should "Deliver working software" frequently. Throughout my career I've definitely been focused on the "working software" portion of this mantra. My favorite topics have been patterns and practices of software engineering with a special emphasis on Test Driven Development. However, in my role at Redacted Financial Services Inc. I've become convinced of the importance of a stable, reliable deployment system. I am now transitioning into a DevOps-y kind of role. My new focus is on the "deliver" portion. I have the honor of a supporting a team of like-minded professionals who are still focused on producing working software.
